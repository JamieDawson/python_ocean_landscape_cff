I'm a Python teacher for [Code for Fun](https://www.codeforfun.com/). This is one of the lesson plans I created for one of my classes.

This project is a combination of several programming concepts we've been working on up until this point. The order in which functions are applied, color manipulation, XY graphs, and other aspects of Python programming.

One of my favorite things about this session was once we were done working on the code, my students came up with new ways to make the landscape look different.
Students would change the colors to make it look like a desert, change the direction of the ocean squares to make it look like waves, and a whole bunch of creative ideas that I was really impressed with. 

Running this code will make the output look like this:
